# (CSCI321) Assembly Language

This repository contains projects and assignments completed for the CSCI 321 Assembly Language class. Each project demonstrates key concepts in assembly programming, including string manipulation, control structures, and basic I/O operations.

## Overview of Projects

### Project 4:
Write a program with a loop and indirect address that copies a string from source to target. Revising the character order in the process. Use the following variables:
  ```
  source BYTE “This is the string that will be reversed”, 0
  target BYTE SIZEOF source DUP(‘#’)
  ```
You may refer to the Programming Exercise #7 on Page 138 of the textbook.

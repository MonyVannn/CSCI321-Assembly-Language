# (CSCI321) Assembly Language

This repository contains projects and assignments completed for the CSCI 321 Assembly Language class. Each project demonstrates key concepts in assembly programming, including string manipulation, control structures, and basic I/O operations.

## Overview of Projects

### Project 1:
Write a C/C++ program that simulate a menu based binary number calculator. This calculate shall have the following three functionalities:
1.	Covert a binary string to corresponding positive integers
2.	Convert a positive integer to its binary representation
3.	Add two binary numbers, both numbers are represented as a string of 0s and 1s

</br>

### Project 2:
Write a C/C++ program that simulate a menu based binary number calculator. This calculate shall have the following five functionalities:
1.	Covert a binary string in two’s complement format to corresponding integers
2.	Convert an integer to its binary representation in two’s complement format
3.	Add two binary numbers, both numbers are represented as a string of 0s and 1s
4.	Provide sign extension for a binary number
5.	Provide two’s complement for a binary nunber

</br>

### Project 3:
Write a program that contain the following:
1.	Using the AddTwo program from Section 3.2 as a reference, write code to calculate the following expression, using registers: A = (A+B)-(C+D). Assign integer values to the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers
2.	Write code that defines symbolic constants for all seven days of the week. Create an array variable that uses the symbols as initializers
3.	The program must contain a definition of each data type listed in Table 3.2 in Section 3.4 of the textbook. Initialize each variable to a value that is consistent with its data type
4.	Write code defines symbolic names for several string literals. Use each symbolic name in a variable definition

</br>

### Project 4:
Write a program with a loop and indirect address that copies a string from source to target. Revising the character order in the process. Use the following variables:
  ```
  source BYTE “This is the string that will be reversed”, 0
  target BYTE SIZEOF source DUP(‘#’)
  ```
You may refer to the Programming Exercise #7 on Page 138 of the textbook.
